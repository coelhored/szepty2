1
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.730
MAYA: We speak, infrequently.

2
00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.200
At length, with interruptions.

3
00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.850
Keep it light, check your impulse,

4
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.960
don’t share too much or too deeply.

5
00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:19.720
Say I love you as much as and as many times as you can.

6
00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.720
Cry quietly. Silence is key.

7
00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:27.670
Lean into your joy.

8
00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.000
Shit, find your joy.

9
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.350
Share what made you smile today.

10
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.200
Harness your desire to scream and climb through the phone.

11
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.850
Breathe deeply, again.

12
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.150
Again. Again.

13
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.110
Dare to dream of the day when you won’t be interrupted in your conversation.

14
00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.860
When keeping it real over keeping it light is safe again.

15
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.070
I want to hold you, your hug tucked into my heart chakra.

16
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.500
Won’t you just come back to me already?

17
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.730
I’m done. I’ve done this for too long alone.

18
00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.690
Holding myself at night,

19
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:17.890
my shoulders ache from hugging myself, every night.

20
00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.320
I told the story of the time I got locked in my bedroom

21
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.390
in movement class the other day.

22
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.370
It brought me such joy to share you and Granny Ma in a neutral space.

23
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.580
I’m missing your non-judgement,

24
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.320
opinions that span the encyclopedia of topics.

25
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.090
You keep me laughing, even in those tiny row seats,

26
00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.400
in the pen that’s supposed to be a visiting room.

27
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.750
I am in stitches from your candour and shameless truth telling.

28
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.220
You taught me not to give a fuck

29
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.180
but always give and get respect.

30
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.240
The cute fakeness does nothing to make us…

31
00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:19.670
or move us forward in career or living truthful, fruitful lives.

32
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.210
Back in the visiting room, families sit,

33
00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.020
packed on top of each other like cattle.

34
00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.210
Chittering and chattering quietly,

35
00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.000
seeking privacy, smiling silently,

36
00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.250
letting the unspoken linger in the physical space.

37
00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.590
The space between. Rare air.

38
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.290
Heartbeats are able to sink up when siting this close.

39
00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:51.690
I wish I could hug you,

40
00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.700
but I don’t want to be yelled at by the overseers again.

41
00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.310
I don’t want to be the reason they treat you bad

42
00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:59.740
– read: beat you up.

43
00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:04.330
When I leave, I don’t want to leave here without your hand in mine.

44
00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.070
Together. Together.

45
00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.170
Together. Together, together, together…

46
00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.950
My best self is saving others, but I can’t even save myself.

47
00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.170
Freedom? Mobility?

48
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.410
Affordance? Humanity?

49
00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:28.630
Individuality?

50
00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.680
Never did extend to me.

51
00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.460
I write you never.

52
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.370
Fearful I’ll error in my transparency.

53
00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.620
You love me. You’re not safe.

54
00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.420
That… didn’t hurt.

55
00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.960
I pulled apart and reshaped.

56
00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.920
You could be free any day and that is eating at me.

57
00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.020
I want to come home.

58
00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:02.290
I want to take care of you.

59
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.840
I want to use the skill I’ve acquired

60
00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.260
to teach you how to live in this world anew.

61
00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.800
I, I… I… I… have to press on.

62
00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.950
My life is dedicated to so many

63
00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.360
and I am not going stop till I reach my goal, but…

64
00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.470
I wanna see you there.

65
00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:26.110
The last graduation.

66
00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.270
First and last.

67
00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.730
The last will become first and the first last.

68
00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.700
Flat out. Little verge.
