00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:21.520
&lt; beach

2
00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:21.650
ambience: waves hitting the shore, wind, distant voices speaking Polish &gt;

3
00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.240
VERONIQUE: There was always a “before” and “after.”

4
00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.600
Not before and after migration – at least, not exactly.

5
00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.350
Something else shaped these two worlds that my mother moved between.

6
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.350
&lt; scarcely perceptible whispers &gt;

7
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:45.730
I couldn’t follow her – but sometimes, when the door was ajar, I could peer

8
00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:45.980
through. &lt; soft, contemplative piano and rythmic tone, beach ambience recedes

9
00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.443
into the background &gt;

10
00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.830
From a young age, I was pulled towards the places

11
00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.370
where reality shows its cracks, its seams.

12
00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.410
At every opening, I strained my ears, listening for snatches of the other side.

13
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.360
Sometimes, this sense of not fully being “here” was an electric charge,

14
00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.690
an incantation, a miraculous melting away of selfhood.

15
00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.410
Sometimes, it was a riptide, which hooked my limbs and sent me spinning into the

16
00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.770
dark. &lt; piano and tone build &gt;

17
00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.870
I couldn’t follow her, so I went somewhere else.

18
00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.580
Still, when I lifted the escape hatch, or slipped between the trees,

19
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.730
part of me searched for the sweep of her shadow,

20
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.510
the flicker of her footfalls, the whisper of her breath.

21
00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:48.077
&lt; beach ambience rises to the foreground &gt;

22
00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:56.443
&lt; piano and tone fade &gt;

23
00:03:08.777 --> 00:03:17.777
&lt; beach ambience gradually fades &gt;
