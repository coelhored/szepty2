00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:02.890
MANUEL: Okay, Mom. We’re recording. So…

2
00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:06.510
TRACEY: I remember many, many years ago,

3
00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:08.390
even when I was a really small girl,

4
00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:09.790
here on this territory of mine,

5
00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.590
where there was always this discussion with people…

6
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.200
given where there were times of being stressed out

7
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.390
and somebody who was close to them noticed that

8
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.650
they had come down with a cold or were not feeling well.

9
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.460
Sometimes it was due to not sleeping,

10
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.030
sometimes it was due to grief and loss…

11
00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:40.270
but it’s this idea that if they were stressed out

12
00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:41.980
or not taking care of themselves,

13
00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.440
like their body… that it would all be connected.

14
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.020
So, if we didn’t take care of our emotions or thinking

15
00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.240
that it would affect our body in a way where we’d become sick.

16
00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.240
And the whole idea speaks to the belief that,

17
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.620
in order to heal ourselves, we must be whole.

18
00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.440
Um, being whole means paying attention to your emotional,

19
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.590
intellectual, spiritual, physical…

20
00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.240
So at times like these,

21
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.400
I would hear people say, you know, maybe,

22
00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.780
“Go to sleep, take care of yourself,

23
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.240
feed yourself properly. And try not to…”

24
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.010
&lt;  Tracey’s voice distorts, becoming unintelligible &gt;

25
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.520
MANUEL: “And they called that being…”

26
00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.080
&lt; Manuel’s voice distorts, becoming unintelligible &gt;

27
00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:36.190
TRACEY: yeah, it was this idea that you were sick due to an imbalance

28
00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.190
that was going on with you. That you were almost…

29
00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.280
you were in a space where your emotions were taken over,

30
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.000
and you weren’t looking after yourself by getting enough sleep

31
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.550
or eating properly, or just…

32
00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:52.390
&lt; Tracey’s voice distorts &gt;

33
00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:55.020
…sick.

34
00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:57.480
MANUEL: Wow.

35
00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.940
TRACEY: I don’t know if that term’s used anywhere else,

36
00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.610
but I don’t that when I use it here, in this territory –

37
00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.690
MANUEL: You’ve never used that term for me.

38
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.710
&lt; Tracey’s laughter distorts, reverberating &gt;

39
00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.320
TRACEY: Um… I guess not.

40
00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:20.310
Because I haven’t really seen you at a space where maybe…

41
00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.430
&lt; Tracey’s voice distorts, reverberating &gt;

42
00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:25.400
…with other things.

43
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.280
MANUEL: I was just having too many feelings.

44
00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.980
TRACEY: Maybe you were just having too many feelings.

45
00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.450
MANUEL: I was pretty crazy.

46
00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.730
&lt; Tracey and Manuel’s laughter warps, fracturing, reverberating &gt;

47
00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.910
TRACEY: I don’t know. Yeah. It’s that idea, you know…

48
00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:43.510
&lt; Tracey’s voice distorts &gt;&lt;

49
00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.970
…say: “Are you getting sleep?

50
00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.950
MANUEL: Mmm. TRACEY: “Did you eat?”...

51
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.150
&lt; Tracey’s voice distorts, reverberating &gt;

52
00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.470
TRACEY: …a lot of these are… &lt; Tracey’s voice distorts, reverberating &gt;

53
00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:56.820
…people are trying to take care of each other.

54
00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.860
They think it’s really important.

55
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.230
MANUEL: Yeah, one of my friends… um…

56
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.040
&lt; Manuel’s voice distorts, fracturing, reverberating &gt;

57
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:08.370
TRACEY: Mmm.

58
00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.450
&lt; Louder, reverberating distortion&lt;

59
00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.110
MANUEL: She was probably…

60
00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.360
&lt; Manuel’s voice distorts, fracturing, reverberating &gt;

61
00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.830
TRACEY: Mmm. Well, that’s sad.

62
00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.890
MANUEL: Yeah…

63
00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.000
&lt; Softer, reverberating distortion &gt;

64
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.060
TRACEY: Yeah.

65
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:29.450
&lt; Softer, reverberating distortion &gt;

66
00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:38.670
Hmm… Yeah. Yep that’s –

67
00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.820
MANUEL: Hmm.

68
00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:39.840
TRACEY: That’s what it is.

69
00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:42.280
MANUEL: Well –

70
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.650
TRACEY: Kind of generally means you’re not taking care of yourself.

71
00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.660
And you get sick, physically sick.

72
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.690
MANUEL: Wow.

73
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.750
TRACEY: Yeah.

74
00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.070
MANUEL: Well, I like that.

75
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.580
TRACEY: Yeah.

76
00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.210
MANUEL: But is it sort of also like a sickness that you would say

77
00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:02.600
is not able to put into a category?

78
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.430
It’s not just being depressed, or just being…

79
00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.310
having a stomach-ache or having a headache?

80
00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:10.680
It’s a combination of all of them?

81
00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.040
TRACEY: Yep. It’s a combination of not paying attention

82
00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.540
to all of your four quadrants, right?

83
00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.300
MANUEL: Yeah.

84
00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:22.200
TRACEY: It’s like a… it’s a complete imbalance, so it comes out as illness…

85
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.840
&lt; Tracy’s voice distorts &gt;

86
00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.430
…yeah.

87
00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.910
MANUEL: No, I don’t. No, I don’t. No, I don’t. No.

88
00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:30.670
&lt; Tracey laughs &gt;

89
00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:31.750
No, I’m not going there…

90
00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.160
$lt; Manuel and Tracey’s laughter warps, fracturing, reverberating &gt;

91
00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.720
…and yeah. It was shitty.

92
00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:39.810
TRACEY: Mmm…

93
00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.710
&lt; Tracey’s voice distorts &gt;

94
00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.120
MANUEL: …but, I don’t know. I smudged last night, so…

95
00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.170
&lt; Manuel’s voice distorts &gt;

96
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:51.580
… that helps.

97
00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.780
TRACEY: I think so.

98
00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:55.130
MANUEL: So –

99
00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:58.630
TRACEY: It’s an interesting… yeah, it’s an interesting thing

100
00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:05.610
because like people can endure… things like, you know, like…

101
00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.190
I don’t know… going for a couple of nights without sleep,

102
00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.030
or whatever, do their work, you know…

103
00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.630
it just means that people are taking care of themselves during that time.

104
00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.550
But when you connect it all with the emotional piece, the spiritual piece,

105
00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.220
when you’re not being connected with Creator and you sort of lose hope,

106
00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:25.850
that’s when everything sort of falls apart…

107
00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:29.390
&lt; Tracey’s voice distorts, reverberating &gt;

108
00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.570
… So.

109
00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:32.080
MANUEL: Yeah. ‘Cause I don’t sleep… enough. But –

110
00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.340
TRACEY: I know –

111
00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:33.360
MANUEL: I guess I’m like –

112
00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.030
TRACEY: I know… yeah, you’re balanced, right?

113
00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.390
MANUEL: I guess I balance it out with all the other shit.

114
00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:40.310
&lt; Manuel and Tracey laugh &gt;

115
00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:47.820
‘Cause I pray and smudge and –

116
00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:48.030
TRACEY: Mm hmm –

117
00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:49.180
MANUEL: And I –

118
00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:50.710
TRACEY: Exercise, eat good food –

119
00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:52.380
MANUEL: Exercise, eat good food.

120
00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:53.890
TRACEY: Yeah.

121
00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:58.050
MANUEL: And, um… I talk about my feelings…

122
00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:58.870
&lt; Manuel laughs a little &gt;

123
00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:00.470
Well, I’ll let you go, Mom.

124
00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.740
TRACEY: I have to go. Yeah, I got an appointment at nine.

125
00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:06.290
MANUEL: Oh god. I got a meeting too. Okay, buh-bye.

126
00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:07.980
TRACEY: Okay, I love you, son. Bye.

127
00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:08.840
MANUEL: Love you too. Bye.

128
00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:09.920
TRACEY: Buh-bye.
