00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:03.170
In my culture and lineage, uh,

2
00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:07.690
people don’t really speak about mental illness very much.

3
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.100
There’s a lot of silence about it.

4
00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:16.320
People tend to sweep it under the carpet or hide it from the public.

5
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.430
They’re ashamed if a family member has a mental illness.

6
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.980
Yeah, as a spokesperson,

7
00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:31.040
I find that I don’t mind calling myself mad or crazy.

8
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.770
It’s a badge of honour, or pride.

9
00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.830
I say: “I’m crazy, crazy about life.”

10
00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.160
Or: “I’m mad, I’m mad about life.”

11
00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.960
There’s a sense of mad pride about it.

12
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.070
But it’s different coming from someone without that lived experience.

13
00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.960
I kind of call myself a born-again,

14
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.570
out-of-the-closet, flaming manic depressive.

15
00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:01.040
Half-jokingly, you know, over the years as a spoken word slam poet,

16
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.930
I’ve become known by my peers and my community as the bipolar poet laureate.

17
00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.800
I think maybe the older generation there’s a greater sense of stigma and shame.

18
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.070
‘Cause I know of relatives who had mental illnesses

19
00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.000
and I didn’t find out about them until much later in life.

20
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.310
Because they were almost kept a secret,

21
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.730
you know, this secret taboo subject.

22
00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:33.800
I have had, uh, in-laws tell their daughter

23
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.400
– my ex-partner, my ex-girlfriend – that, you know:

24
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.390
“Kagan is mentally ill.

25
00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.120
He has manic depression,

26
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.830
which is a lifelong illness, an incurable illness.

27
00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.210
You know, if you had children,

28
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.160
they would have a twenty percent chance of being mentally ill.

29
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:58.710
Would you want that?” Sometimes people are afraid to disclose

30
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.590
that they have a mental illness because they’re afraid

31
00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.400
that they’ll be discriminated against.

32
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.740
But, to be honest, I see it as a mutual litmus test,

33
00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.040
in terms of they might be discriminating against me

34
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.790
but I’m also being discerning.

35
00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.130
So, it’s a way of weeding out the wheat from the chaff,

36
00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.740
separating the light from the darkness, the good from the bad,

37
00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.220
the positive from the negative, the people who are worth associating

38
00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.700
and people who I’d rather avoid.

39
00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.680
And the people that do remain tend to be more supportive,

40
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.540
understanding, compassionate, kind, caring.

41
00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.250
Instead of having a legion of acquaintances,

42
00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.840
friends and family that you have a superficial relationship with,

43
00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.170
you can have a more authentic and genuine relationship

44
00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.330
with people who are more real and authentic with you.

45
00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.120
It’s really interesting, people often talk about the stigma

46
00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.740
and the curse of mental illness, as if it’s a great burden,

47
00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.280
a cross to bear, you know.

48
00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.510
But what they don’t realize

49
00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.650
is with every negative there’s a positive,

50
00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.060
there’s a yin-yang to every relationship.

51
00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:16.560
People who suffer can empathize and relate to other people who have suffered.

52
00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.750
So, they extend themselves to others more.

53
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:29.200
Um, hypomania for example can lead to incredible flights of fancy

54
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.180
and inventiveness and creativity and some of my best work

55
00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.850
has come out of those states of consciousness.

56
00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:42.550
Obviously, people sometimes get addicted to the highs of hypomania or mania,

57
00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.950
and later on they crash and experience depression.

58
00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:52.280
But I’ve learned how to experience hypomania and bring myself down gently.

59
00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.330
My mom, my mother, once said to me: “Of all the four sons that I’ve had,

60
00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:02.820
you’ve been dealt the worst hand… of all the cards… of all the brothers.

61
00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.070
But you’ve played your hand extremely well.”
