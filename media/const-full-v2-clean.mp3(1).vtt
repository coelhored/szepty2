00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:05.590
you have been cursed with having a happy child in a place where everything dies

2
00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.800
you promised yourself they will never be in need and they will never feel

3
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.270
afraid.  (like you are)

4
00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:11.990
and you kept that promise.

5
00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.440
and you hate it. something is very wrong with your child and everyone but them

6
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.290
knows this. the people say "are they alright?"

7
00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.200
with their teeth and claws bare, pure black in the absence of light,

8
00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.890
and you have to say “of course not!” and you turn to them and say.

9
00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.570
“stop it, you broken little monster!” and they say "i'm not!",

10
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.300
and they mean it, so no threats or screams of yours can make them stop it

11
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.000
you can't apologize for it after all,

12
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.740
nothing is wrong, of course not

13
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.040
so you sneak in their bedroom at night to whisper

14
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.630
“gxd knows i want you to be happy”

15
00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:49.170
and you do mean it and you really don't you know that the longer you wait,

16
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.600
the more dangerous it becomes.

17
00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:52.950
you know what happens to defective children.

18
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.760
they die. and the ones still alive, you wish they were gone,

19
00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.650
no longer burdened by their deviancy

20
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.250
so you do what all loving parents would do

21
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.910
when you squeeze their hand tight in yours, lilac circles blooming,

22
00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.660
their filth ready to break the skin and leave their body

23
00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:09.930
so that they will be happy again

24
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.270
but you catch their confused gaze and realize this happiness is not yours to

25
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.510
take. you take all the words that can name their brokenness instead,

26
00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.090
childproof the mother tongue,

27
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.670
just not to alarm any more hounds that are ready

28
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:24.990
to pounce at the sound of it

29
00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.900
you have to take it away to keep them safe.

30
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.680
but they are dying anyway when you find them in a psych ward,

31
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.440
you fight every day to bring what's left of them home in a trash bag,

32
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.110
never to be spoken of again you tell everyone that they are fine,

33
00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.250
just exam stress, but you no longer see anyone behind their eyes

34
00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.890
your happy child is not in need and is not afraid

35
00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.740
and is dying and you love them so, so much.

36
00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.860
so when you pack their lifeless body in a suitcase

37
00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.370
you hope that the silence

38
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.140
will deliver them on a shore far away

39
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.580
safe.
