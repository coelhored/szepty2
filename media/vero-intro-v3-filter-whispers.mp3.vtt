00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:05.390
&lt; beach ambience, waves hitting the shore, &gt;

2
00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:10.390
&lt; wind, faint music, bird calls &gt;

3
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.390
&lt; distant voices converse in Polish &gt;

4
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:23.390
Mental health awareness campaigns often ask us to break the silence.

5
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:36.353
But the decision to speak, or not to speak, is a complicated one.

6
00:00:36.353 --> 00:00:41.170
And the question of how we describe our experiences is just as complicated.

7
00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.010
The language of mental health is shaped by particular histories,

8
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.440
which reverberate in the present.

9
00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.950
As the descendent of people who didn’t talk about mental health for generations,

10
00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.060
I’m curious about speech and silence.

11
00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.040
My context, as a settler Canadian who benefits from a colonial occupation,

12
00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.380
is very different from the context of my ancestors,

13
00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.120
Poles who lived under Soviet, Nazi, and Austro-Hungarian regimes.

14
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:27.770
I can’t solve their silence because I don’t know what speaking meant to them.

15
00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.460
I don’t know how they understood their minds and bodies,

16
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.050
or how they gave voice to that understanding.

17
00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:38.060
I don’t know how they communicated what they didn’t have words for.

18
00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:46.150
I wonder: what words do you use?

19
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.660
Whose words do you use?

20
00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.180
How did they reach you?

21
00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.800
Through stories? Omissions?

22
00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.640
Songs? Contradictions?

23
00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.220
Rituals? Inferences?

24
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.550
Sensations? Whispers?

25
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.500
When do your words run out? What does your silence hold space for?

26
00:02:18.347 --> 00:02:20.457
I brought these questions to seven other artists.

27
00:02:21.583 --> 00:02:23.683
Click begin to explore their responses.

28
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.110
Each page will ask you to choose between two fragments.

29
00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.690
Different choices will lead to different outcomes.

30
00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.890
&lt; beach ambience rises to the foreground again &gt;

31
00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:45.890
&lt; voices conversing in Polish &gt;

32
00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.890
&lt; piano and tone fade &gt;

33
00:02:50.891 --> 00:02:54.890
&lt; Beach ambience fades &gt;

34
00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.890
&lt; static crackles softly &gt;
