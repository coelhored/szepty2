00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:05.390
&lt; beach ambience, waves hitting the shore, &gt;

2
00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:10.390
&lt; wind, faint music, bird calls &gt;

3
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.390
&lt; distant voices converse in Polish &gt;

4
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.790
Mental health awareness campaigns often ask us to break the silence.

5
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:35.080
But the decision to speak, or not to speak, is a complicated one.

6
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:41.160
And the question of how we describe our experiences is just as complicated.

7
00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.450
The language of mental health is shaped by particular histories, which reverberate in the present.

8
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.970
As the descendent of people who didn’t talk about mental health for generations,

9
00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.060
I’m curious about speech and silence.

10
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.210
My context, as a settler Canadian who benefits from a colonial occupation,

11
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.520
is very different from the context of my ancestors,

12
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.470
Poles who lived under Soviet, Nazi, and Austro-Hungarian regimes.

13
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.540
I can’t solve their silence because I don’t know what speaking meant to them.

14
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.610
I don’t know how they understood their minds and bodies,

15
00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.170
or how they gave voice to that understanding.

16
00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.180
I don’t know how they communicated what they didn’t have words for.

17
00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.290
I wonder, what words do you use?

18
00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.320
Whose words do you use? How did they reach you?

19
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.520
Through stories?

20
00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.780
Omissions? Songs? Contradictions?

21
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.520
Rituals? Inferences? Sensations?

22
00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.670
Whispers?

23
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.170
When do your words run out?

24
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.570
What does your silence hold space for?

25
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.930
I brought these questions to seven other artists.

26
00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.860
Click begin to explore their responses.

27
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.600
Each page will ask you to choose between two fragments.

28
00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.720
Different choices will lead to different outcomes.

29
00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.890
&lt; beach ambience rises to the foreground again &gt;

30
00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:45.890
&lt; voices conversing in Polish &gt;

31
00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.890
&lt; piano and tone fade &gt;

32
00:02:50.891 --> 00:02:54.890
&lt; Beach ambience fades &gt;

33
00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.890
&lt; static crackles softly &gt;
