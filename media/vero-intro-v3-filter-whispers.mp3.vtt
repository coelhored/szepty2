00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:05.390
&lt; beach ambience, waves hitting the shore, &gt;

2
00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:10.390
&lt; wind, faint music, bird calls &gt;

3
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.390
&lt; distant voices converse in Polish &gt;

4
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:28.390
VERONIQUE: Mental health awareness campaigns often ask us to break the silence.

5
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:35.060
But the decision to speak, or not to speak, is a complicated one.

6
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:41.170
And the question of how we describe our experiences is just as complicated.

7
00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.070
The language of mental health is shaped by particular histories, which

8
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.440
reverberate in the present.

9
00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.950
As the descendent of people who didn’t talk about mental health for generations,

10
00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.060
I’m curious about speech and silence.

11
00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:10.100
My context, as a settler Canadian who benefits from a colonial occupation, is

12
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.380
very different from the context of my ancestors,

13
00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.120
Poles who lived under Soviet, Nazi, and Austro-Hungarian regimes.

14
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:27.770
I can’t solve their silence because I don’t know what speaking meant to them.

15
00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.140
I don’t know how they understood their minds and bodies, or how they gave voice

16
00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.470
to that understanding. I don’t know how they communicated what they didn’t have

17
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:46.150
words for. I wonder: what words do you use?

18
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.660
Whose words do you use?

19
00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.380
How did they reach you? Through stories?

20
00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.830
Omissions? Songs?

21
00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.410
Contradictions? Rituals?

22
00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.220
Inferences?

23
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.550
Sensations? Whispers?

24
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:10.960
When do your words run out?

25
00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.500
What does your silence hold space for?

26
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.790
I brought these questions to seven other artists.

27
00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.800
Click begin to explore their responses.

28
00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.460
Each page will ask you to choose between two fragments.

29
00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.160
Different choices will lead to different outcomes.

30
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.890
&lt; beach ambience rises to the foreground again &gt;

31
00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.890
&lt; voices conversing in Polish &gt;

32
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:55.890
&lt; piano and tone fade &gt;

33
00:02:59.891 --> 00:03:08.890
&lt; Beach ambience fades &gt;

34
00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:20.890
&lt; static crackles softly &gt;
