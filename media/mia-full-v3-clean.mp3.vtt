00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.400
mia: &lt; in Hebrew, feminine conjugation &gt; You are crazy.

00:00:03.401 --> 00:00:06.400
&lt; in Hebrew, masculine conjugation &gt; You are crazy.

1
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:15.710
So, my mother’s whole family was characterized as crazy.

2
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:26.410
She had a deep, deep mistrust of, uh,

3
00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.250
mental health professionals and doctors.

4
00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:39.450
When I… started to embark on my healing journey

5
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.350
and when I would attempt to assert, you know,

6
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:50.140
healthy boundaries or to resist relational patterns

7
00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:56.250
or dynamics that produced harm or violence,

8
00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.020
my mom would always blame my therapists.

9
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.770
And I guess, in a way, I understand why,

10
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.010
because there was no way for me to represent to a therapist

11
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.240
the whole story of my mother’s life,

12
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.160
why she was the way she was.

13
00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:18.970
There were reasons.

14
00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:27.070
There were reasons. I think that my mother, being the product of her family of

15
00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.180
origin, her family of origin being so shaped

16
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.590
by war and displacement and genocide,

17
00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.350
um, there’s a, you know, there’s a generation there…

18
00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:49.590
the generation that had to find ways to proceed with life after horror,

19
00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.300
with the memory of horror.

20
00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.880
And how do you live with that?

21
00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.480
Where do you take that? What do you do with it?

22
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.480
How do you accept the fact that you are still alive?

23
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.810
That generation… swallowed everything up,

24
00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.520
into their bodies and into their… psyches.

25
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:27.050
Those… experiences are too big to live in single human bodies,

26
00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.060
so they swallow everything when we try to swallow them.

27
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:41.930
Mental health and the impacts of trauma,

28
00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.730
in the narrative of… in the narrative of my family,

29
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:56.380
has often, if not always, been divorced from context.

30
00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.590
Our behaviours, our utterances of madness

31
00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:10.250
become divorced from the circumstances out of which they needed to arise,

32
00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.790
often as strategies for survival.

33
00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:23.640
But context and justification, uh, are not

34
00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:29.830
synonymous. And I think that’s where we differ.

35
00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.700
The context doesn’t justify the outcomes...

36
00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.820
But I suppose that I am in a much more privileged state

37
00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.590
than my mother ever was,

38
00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:54.600
wherein mental health is not as stigmatized.

39
00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:05.920
My mother’s inability to… unwillingness… fear…

40
00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:12.040
of addressing these experiences…

41
00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:18.300
everything she could, she put into her music.

42
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:27.160
She was a violinist and it all went there.

43
00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:33.610
And what a gift, to have had such a vehicle,

44
00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.270
such a place to wordlessly express… to… to…

45
00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.090
wordlessly empty out that which is far too vast

46
00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.750
for human language to contain.
