00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.740
JIVESH: I think the… the description, the word,

2
00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.560
that best was used to describe mental illness

3
00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:13.860
or any kind of neurodiversity would be something like “nerves.”

4
00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.370
“They have nerves.” Um, or: “Their nerves are acting up.”

5
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.010
Something like that. Uh, if you had nerves you would go and see the pandit.

6
00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.970
Basically, you would go and see somebody, uh,

7
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.790
whose spiritual practice might not be recognized,

8
00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.780
I suppose, by the state and culture that the state was pushing…

9
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.890
well, in this case – if you go far enough back –

10
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.470
that the Crown was pushing.

11
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.300
It does sometimes feel like nerves, at least for me.

12
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.190
And… there is something about going to see a pandit,

13
00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.010
or – since I didn’t grow up really being able to do that

14
00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:56.610
– like some kind of spiritual piece, um… whatever it is,

15
00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.050
and those also come with medicinal practices too.

16
00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.790
It’s not just like: “I go, I pray or something, and I’m good.”

17
00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.370
There’s… there’s other factors to it.

18
00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.290
There’s medicine. There’s process.

19
00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.510
Um… a lot of those things we don’t really have access to anymore though,

20
00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.240
because we maybe just didn’t have much autonomy over how we,

21
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:24.520
uh… how we lived our lives, um, because… we were there to do a job.

22
00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.870
The conditions that, you know, really up till recently,

23
00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.090
um… in the Caribbean, for my people, were not awesome.

24
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.850
Um… there was stresses involved and there was isolation involved and,

25
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.950
um… you know, they did have community, but they had left a lot.

26
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.230
A lot of people had left a lot.

27
00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.910
And… all they really did now was work.

28
00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.440
You get up. You go to the field.

29
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.270
You cut the cane. You set the cane on fire…

30
00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.630
I suppose, like, I trace, you know… my non-spiritual,

31
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.280
but maybe more secular ways of thinking

32
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.430
to a lot of… scholarship, really.

33
00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.770
So people like Frantz Fanon, I think, are interesting.

34
00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:20.650
And people like Fanon really brought something new to that field of…

35
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.110
I guess, psychiatry, um… his clinical work in Algeria

36
00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.060
and then later trying to apply that as a way to understand the…

37
00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:38.680
the impacts of colonization on, uh… a subject of colonization…

38
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.400
um, yeah.

39
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.060
You know, like talking about it as “double consciousness” from Du Bois.

40
00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.070
Talking about it as “a nervous condition” from Fanon.

41
00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.080
Yeah. And mental illness, right, it’s a thing where…

42
00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.100
I think, at least for me…

43
00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.020
the framing part is what really matters,

44
00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.640
‘cause… yeah.
