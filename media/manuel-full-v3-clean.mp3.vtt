00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:02.230
MANUEL: Okay, Mom. We’re recording.

2
00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:08.010
So… TRACEY: I remember many, many years ago, even when I was a really small

3
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.880
girl, here on this territory of mine, where there was always this discussion

4
00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:19.170
with people… given where there were times of being stressed out and somebody

5
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:26.880
who was close to them noticed that they had come down with a cold or were not

6
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.910
feeling well. Sometimes it was due to not sleeping, sometimes it was due to

7
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:41.020
grief and loss… but it’s this idea that if they were stressed out or not taking

8
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.440
care of themselves, like their body… that it would all be connected.

9
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.020
So, if we didn’t take care of our emotions or thinking

10
00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.240
that it would affect our body in a way where we’d become sick.

11
00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.240
And the whole idea speaks to the belief that,

12
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.620
in order to heal ourselves, we must be whole.

13
00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.440
Um, being whole means paying attention to your emotional,

14
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.590
intellectual, spiritual, physical…

15
00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.400
So at times like these, I would hear people say, you know, maybe,:

16
00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.530
“Go to sleep, take care of yourself, feed yourself properly.

17
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.930
And try not to…” &lt; Tracey’s voice distorts, becoming unintelligible &gt;


18
00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.520
MANUEL: “And they called that being…”

19
00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.830
&lt; Manuel’s voice distorts, becoming unintelligible &gt;


20
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:36.190
TRACEY: yeah, it was this idea that you were sick due to an imbalance

21
00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.310
that was going on with you.

22
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.190
That you were almost…

23
00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.280
you were in a space where your emotions were taken over,

24
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.000
and you weren’t looking after yourself by getting enough sleep

25
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.550
or eating properly, or just…

26
00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:52.780
&lt; Tracey’s voice distorts &gt;
 TRACEY: …sick.

27
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.740
MANUEL: Wow.

28
00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:00.940
TRACEY: I don’t know if that term’s used anywhere else,

29
00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.480
but I don’t that when I use it here, in this territory –

30
00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.690
MANUEL: You’ve never used that term for me.

31
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.710
&lt; Tracey’s laughter distorts, reverberating &gt;


32
00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.320
TRACEY: Um… I guess not.

33
00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:20.310
Because I haven’t really seen you at a space where maybe…

34
00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.160
&lt; Tracey’s voice distorts, reverberating &gt;


35
00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.190
TRACEY: …with other things.

36
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.280
MANUEL: I was just having too many feelings.

37
00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.840
TRACEY: Maybe you were just having too many feelings.

38
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.120
MANUEL: I was pretty crazy.

39
00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.810
&lt; Tracey and Manuel’s laughter warps, fracturing, reverberating &gt;


40
00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.600
TRACEY: I don’t know. Yeah. It’s that idea, you know…

41
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.520
&lt; Tracey’s voice distorts &gt;


42
00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.180
TRACEY: …say: “Are you getting sleep?

43
00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.950
MANUEL: Mmm. TRACEY: “Did you eat?”...

44
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.150
&lt; Tracey’s voice distorts, reverberating &gt;


45
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.560
TRACEY: …a lot of these are…

46
00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.840
&lt; Tracey’s voice distorts, reverberating &gt;


47
00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.750
TRACEY: …people are trying to take care of each other.

48
00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.820
They think it’s really important.

49
00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.980
MANUEL: Yeah, one of my friends… um…

50
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.020
&lt; Manuel’s voice distorts, fracturing, reverberating &gt;


51
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.370
TRACEY: Mmm.

52
00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.170
&lt; Louder, reverberating distortion &gt;


53
00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.150
MANUEL: She was probably…

54
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.900
&lt; Manuel’s voice distorts, fracturing, reverberating &gt;


55
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.860
TRACEY: Mmm. Well, that’s sad.

56
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.480
MANUEL: Yeah… &lt; Softer, reverberating distortion &gt;


57
00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.150
TRACEY: Yeah.

58
00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.540
&lt; Softer, reverberating distortion &gt;


59
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.510
TRACEY: Hmm… Yeah.

60
00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.340
Yep that’s – MANUEL: Hmm. TRACEY: That’s what it is.

61
00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.120
MANUEL: Well –

62
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.650
TRACEY: Kind of generally means you’re not taking care of yourself.

63
00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.180
And you get sick, physically sick.

64
00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.480
MANUEL: Wow. TRACEY: Yeah.

65
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.070
MANUEL: Well, I like that.

66
00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:55.240
TRACEY: Yeah.

67
00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.210
MANUEL: But is it sort of also like a sickness that you would say

68
00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:02.600
is not able to put into a category?

69
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.430
It’s not just being depressed, or just being…

70
00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.310
having a stomach-ache or having a headache?

71
00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:10.620
It’s a combination of all of them?

72
00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.210
TRACEY: Yep.

73
00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.040
It’s a combination of not paying attention

74
00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.540
to all of your four quadrants, right?

75
00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:21.640
MANUEL: Yeah. TRACEY: It’s like a… it’s a complete imbalance, so it comes out as

76
00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:23.500
illness… &lt; Tracy’s voice distorts &gt;


77
00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.320
TRACEY: …yeah.

78
00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.820
MANUEL: No, I don’t.

79
00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.240
No, I don’t. No, I don’t.

80
00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.750
No. &lt; Tracey laughs --
 MANUEL: No, I’m not going there…

81
00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.160
&lt; Manuel and Tracey’s laughter warps, fracturing, reverberating &gt;


82
00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:38.870
MANUEL: …and yeah.

83
00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:40.920
It was shitty. TRACEY: Mmm…

84
00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:46.930
&lt; Tracey’s voice distorts &gt;
 MANUEL: …but, I don’t know.

85
00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.120
I smudged last night, so…

86
00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.560
&lt; Manuel’s voice distorts &gt;
 MANUEL: … that helps.

87
00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:52.670
TRACEY: I think so.

88
00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:55.040
MANUEL: So –

89
00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.630
TRACEY: It’s an interesting… yeah, it’s an interesting thing

90
00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:05.610
because like people can endure… things like, you know, like…

91
00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.190
I don’t know… going for a couple of nights without sleep,

92
00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.030
or whatever, do their work, you know…

93
00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.630
it just means that people are taking care of themselves during that time.

94
00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.550
But when you connect it all with the emotional piece, the spiritual piece,

95
00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.220
when you’re not being connected with Creator and you sort of lose hope,

96
00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:25.850
that’s when everything sort of falls apart…

97
00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:29.390
&lt; Tracey’s voice distorts, reverberating &gt;


98
00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:31.800
TRACEY:… So. MANUEL: Yeah. ‘Cause I don’t sleep… enough.

99
00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.250
But – TRACEY: I know – MANUEL: I guess I’m like –

100
00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.030
TRACEY: I know… yeah, you’re balanced, right?

101
00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.390
MANUEL: I guess I balance it out with all the other shit.

102
00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:39.780
&lt; Manuel and Tracey laugh &gt;


103
00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:47.140
MANUEL: ‘Cause I pray and smudge and –

104
00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.180
TRACEY: Mm hmm – MANUEL: And I –

105
00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:51.060
TRACEY: Exercise, eat good food –

106
00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.120
MANUEL: Exercise, eat good food.

107
00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:53.890
TRACEY: Yeah.

108
00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.120
MANUEL: And, um… I talk about my feelings…

109
00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:59.790
&lt; Manuel laughs a little &gt;


110
00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:00.810
MANUEL: Well, I’ll let you go, Mom.

111
00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:04.070
TRACEY: I have to go. Yeah, I got an appointment at nine.

112
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:05.550
MANUEL: Oh god. I got a meeting too.

113
00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:07.760
Okay, buh-bye. TRACEY: Okay, I love you, son.

114
00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.920
Bye. MANUEL: Love you too. Bye. TRACEY: Buh-bye.
