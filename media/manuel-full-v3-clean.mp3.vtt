00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:02.880
MANUEL: Okay, Mom. We’re recording. So…

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.510
TRACEY: I remember many, many years ago,

3
00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:08.390
even when I was a really small girl,

4
00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:09.790
here on this territory of mine,

5
00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.590
where there was always this discussion with people…

6
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.200
given where there were times of being stressed out

7
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.390
and somebody who was close to them noticed that

8
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.650
they had come down with a cold or were not feeling well.

9
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.460
Sometimes it was due to not sleeping,

10
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.030
sometimes it was due to grief and loss…

11
00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:40.270
but it’s this idea that if they were stressed out

12
00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:41.980
or not taking care of themselves,

13
00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.440
like their body… that it would all be connected.

14
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.020
So, if we didn’t take care of our emotions or thinking

15
00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.240
that it would affect our body in a way where we’d become sick.

16
00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.240
And the whole idea speaks to the belief that,

17
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.620
in order to heal ourselves, we must be whole.

18
00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.440
Um, being whole means paying attention to your emotional,

19
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.590
intellectual, spiritual, physical…

20
00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.240
So at times like these,

21
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.400
I would hear people say, you know, maybe,

22
00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.780
“Go to sleep, take care of yourself,

23
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.250
feed yourself properly. And try not to…”

24
00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.930
&lt; Tracey’s voice distorts, becoming unintelligible &gt;

25
00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.520
MANUEL: “And they called that being…”

26
00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.830
&lt; Manuel’s voice distorts, becoming unintelligible &gt;

27
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:36.190
TRACEY: yeah, it was this idea that you were sick due to an imbalance

28
00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.190
that was going on with you. That you were almost…

29
00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.280
you were in a space where your emotions were taken over,

30
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.000
and you weren’t looking after yourself by getting enough sleep

31
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.550
or eating properly, or just…

32
00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:52.390
&lt; Tracey’s voice distorts &gt;

33
00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.780
TRACEY: …sick.

34
00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:59.740
MANUEL: Wow.

35
00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.940
TRACEY: I don’t know if that term’s used anywhere else,

36
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.480
but I don’t that when I use it here, in this territory –

37
00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.690
MANUEL: You’ve never used that term for me.

38
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.710
&lt; Tracey’s laughter distorts, reverberating &gt;

39
00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.320
TRACEY: Um… I guess not.

40
00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:20.310
Because I haven’t really seen you at a space where maybe…

41
00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.160
&lt; Tracey’s voice distorts, reverberating &gt;

42
00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.190
TRACEY: …with other things.

43
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.280
MANUEL: I was just having too many feelings.

44
00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.840
TRACEY: Maybe you were just having too many feelings.

45
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.120
MANUEL: I was pretty crazy.

46
00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.810
&lt; Tracey and Manuel’s laughter warps, fracturing, reverberating &gt;

47
00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.600
TRACEY: I don’t know. Yeah. It’s that idea, you know…

48
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.520
&lt; Tracey’s voice distorts &gt;

49
00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.180
TRACEY: …say: “Are you getting sleep?

50
00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.970
MANUEL: Mmm.

51
00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.950
TRACEY: “Did you eat?”...

52
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.150
&lt; Tracey’s voice distorts, reverberating &gt;

53
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.560
TRACEY: …a lot of these are…

54
00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.840
&lt; Tracey’s voice distorts, reverberating &gt;

55
00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.750
TRACEY: …people are trying to take care of each other.

56
00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.820
They think it’s really important.

57
00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.980
MANUEL: Yeah, one of my friends… um…

58
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.020
&lt; Manuel’s voice distorts, fracturing, reverberating &gt;

59
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.370
TRACEY: Mmm.

60
00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.170
&lt; Louder, reverberating distortion &gt;

61
00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.150
MANUEL: She was probably…

62
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.900
&lt; Manuel’s voice distorts, fracturing, reverberating &gt;

63
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.860
TRACEY: Mmm. Well, that’s sad.

64
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:21.220
MANUEL: Yeah…

65
00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.480
&lt; Softer, reverberating distortion &gt;

66
00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.150
TRACEY: Yeah.

67
00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.540
&lt; Softer, reverberating distortion &gt;

68
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:36.220
TRACEY: Hmm… Yeah. Yep that’s –

69
00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.640
MANUEL: Hmm.

70
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.340
TRACEY: That’s what it is.

71
00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.120
MANUEL: Well –

72
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.650
TRACEY: Kind of generally means you’re not taking care of yourself.

73
00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.180
And you get sick, physically sick.

74
00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.660
MANUEL: Wow.

75
00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:49.480
TRACEY: Yeah.

76
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.070
MANUEL: Well, I like that.

77
00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:55.240
TRACEY: Yeah.

78
00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.210
MANUEL: But is it sort of also like a sickness that you would say

79
00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:02.600
is not able to put into a category?

80
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.430
It’s not just being depressed, or just being…

81
00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.310
having a stomach-ache or having a headache?

82
00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:10.620
It’s a combination of all of them?

83
00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.040
TRACEY: Yep. It’s a combination of not paying attention

84
00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.540
to all of your four quadrants, right?

85
00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.290
MANUEL: Yeah.

86
00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.200
TRACEY: It’s like a… it’s a complete imbalance, so it comes out as illness…

87
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.500
&lt; Tracy’s voice distorts &gt;

88
00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.320
TRACEY: …yeah.

89
00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.420
MANUEL: No, I don’t. No, I don’t. No, I don’t. No.

90
00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:30.030
&lt; Tracey laughs &gt;

91
00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:31.750
MANUEL: No, I’m not going there…

92
00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.160
Manuel and Tracey’s laughter warps, fracturing, reverberating

93
00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.780
MANUEL: …and yeah. It was shitty.

94
00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.920
TRACEY: Mmm…

95
00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:43.080
&lt; Tracey’s voice distorts &gt;

96
00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:49.120
MANUEL: …but, I don’t know. I smudged last night, so…

97
00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.970
&lt; Manuel’s voice distorts &gt;

98
00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:51.560
MANUEL: … that helps.

99
00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:52.670
TRACEY: I think so.

100
00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:55.040
MANUEL: So –

101
00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.630
TRACEY: It’s an interesting… yeah, it’s an interesting thing

102
00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:05.610
because like people can endure… things like, you know, like…

103
00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.190
I don’t know… going for a couple of nights without sleep,

104
00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.030
or whatever, do their work, you know…

105
00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.630
it just means that people are taking care of themselves during that time.

106
00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.550
But when you connect it all with the emotional piece, the spiritual piece,

107
00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.220
when you’re not being connected with Creator and you sort of lose hope,

108
00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:25.850
that’s when everything sort of falls apart…

109
00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:29.390
&lt; Tracey’s voice distorts, reverberating &gt;

110
00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:29.860
TRACEY:… So.

111
00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:31.930
MANUEL: Yeah. ‘Cause I don’t sleep… enough. But –

112
00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:32.280
TRACEY: I know –

113
00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:33.250
MANUEL: I guess I’m like –

114
00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.030
TRACEY: I know… yeah, you’re balanced, right?

115
00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.390
MANUEL: I guess I balance it out with all the other shit.

116
00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:39.780
&lt; Manuel and Tracey laugh &gt;

117
00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:47.140
MANUEL: ‘Cause I pray and smudge and –

118
00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.880
TRACEY: Mm hmm –

119
00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.180
MANUEL: And I –

120
00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:51.060
TRACEY: Exercise, eat good food –

121
00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.120
MANUEL: Exercise, eat good food.

122
00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:53.890
TRACEY: Yeah.

123
00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.120
MANUEL: And, um… I talk about my feelings…

124
00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:59.790
&lt; Manuel laughs a little]

125
00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:00.810
MANUEL: Well, I’ll let you go, Mom.

126
00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:04.070
TRACEY: I have to go. Yeah, I got an appointment at nine.

127
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:06.310
MANUEL: Oh god. I got a meeting too. Okay, buh-bye.

128
00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:08.040
TRACEY: Okay, I love you, son. Bye.

129
00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:08.680
MANUEL: Love you too. Bye.

130
00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:09.920
TRACEY: Buh-bye.
