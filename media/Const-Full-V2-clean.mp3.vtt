00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:03.970
CONSTANTIN: you have been cursed with having a happy child

2
00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:05.590
in a place where everything dies

3
00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:07.470
you promised yourself they will never

4
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.300
be in need and they will never feel afraid

5
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.990
like you are and you kept that promise.

6
00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.490
and you hate it. something is very wrong with your child

7
00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:17.120
and everyone but them knows this

8
00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.290
the people say "are they alright?"

9
00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:20.960
with their teeth and claws bare,

10
00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.200
pure black in the absence of light,

11
00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.350
and you have to say “of course not!”

12
00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:26.890
and you turn to them and say

13
00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:28.810
“stop it, you broken little monster!”

14
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.680
and they say "i'm not!", and they mean it,

15
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.300
so no threats or screams of yours can make them stop it

16
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.360
you can't apologize for it -

17
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.540
after all, nothing is wrong, of course not

18
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.040
so you sneak in their bedroom at night to whisper

19
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.630
“gxd knows i want you to be happy”

20
00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.880
and you do mean it and you really don't

21
00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.600
you know that the longer you wait, the more dangerous it becomes.

22
00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:52.950
you know what happens to defective children.

23
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.830
they die. and the ones still alive,

24
00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:57.760
you wish they were gone,

25
00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.650
no longer burdened by their deviancy

26
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.250
so you do what all loving parents would do

27
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.410
when you squeeze their hand tight in yours,

28
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:05.910
lilac circles blooming,

29
00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.660
their filth ready to break the skin and leave their body

30
00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:09.930
so that they will be happy again

31
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.200
but you catch their confused gaze and realize

32
00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.690
this happiness is not yours to take.

33
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.510
you take all the words that can name their brokenness instead,

34
00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.090
childproof the mother tongue,

35
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.350
just not to alarm any more hounds

36
00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.990
that are ready to pounce at the sound of it

37
00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.900
you have to take it away to keep them safe.

38
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.010
but they are dying anyway

39
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.680
when you find them in a psych ward,

40
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.440
you fight every day to bring what's left of them home in a trash bag,

41
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.050
never to be spoken of again

42
00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.110
you tell everyone that they are fine,

43
00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.250
just exam stress, but you no longer see anyone behind their eyes

44
00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.110
your happy child is not in need and is not afraid and is dying

45
00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.740
and you love them so, so much.

46
00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.860
so when you pack their lifeless body in a suitcase

47
00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.370
you hope that the silence

48
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.140
will deliver them on a shore far away

49
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.580
safe.
