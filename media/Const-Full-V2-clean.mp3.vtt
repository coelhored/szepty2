00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:05.590
CONSTANTIN: you have been cursed with having a happy child in a place where everything dies

2
00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:09.300
you promised yourself they will never be in need and they will never feel afraid

3
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.990
(like you are) and you kept that promise.

4
00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.440
and you hate it. something is very wrong with your child and everyone but them

5
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.960
knows this the people say "are they alright?" with their teeth and claws bare,

6
00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.350
pure black in the absence of light, and you have to say “of course not!”

7
00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.810
and you turn to them and say “stop it, you broken little monster!”

8
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.490
and they say "i'm not!", and they mean it, so no threats or screams of yours can

9
00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:37.960
make them stop it you can't apologize for it - after all, nothing is wrong, of

10
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.040
course not so you sneak in their bedroom at night to whisper

11
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.880
“gxd knows i want you to be happy” and you do mean it and you really don't

12
00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.600
you know that the longer you wait, the more dangerous it becomes.

13
00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:52.950
you know what happens to defective children.

14
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.640
they die. and the ones still alive, you wish they were gone, no longer burdened

15
00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:59.650
by their deviancy

16
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.770
so you do what all loving parents would do when you squeeze their hand tight in

17
00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.080
yours, lilac circles blooming, their filth ready to break the skin and leave

18
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.930
their body so that they will be happy again

19
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.200
but you catch their confused gaze and realize

20
00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.690
this happiness is not yours to take.

21
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.510
you take all the words that can name their brokenness instead,

22
00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.670
childproof the mother tongue, just not to alarm any more hounds that are ready

23
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:24.990
to pounce at the sound of it

24
00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:32.230
you have to take it away to keep them safe.

25
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.050
but they

26
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.180
are dying

27
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.140
anyway
