00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:04.200
KENDRA: There is no word for trauma.

2
00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.220
Not shellshock or combat fatigue.

3
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.920
Not mental health or a diagnosis as disorder.

4
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.960
Not suffering. There is no cure for what happens.

5
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.650
There are appearances.

6
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.160
There is being unrealistic.

7
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:39.210
The family as people related by a shared inner veil.

8
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.290
The shroud distinguishing between the symbolized and the nothing,

9
00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.130
as natural history like substance.

10
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.300
There is a nurse, a single mother to seven who never complains.

11
00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.260
As she disappears through her skeleton,

12
00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.960
her hands move away the pain,

13
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:05.950
even when there is nowhere else for anything or anyone to go.

14
00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.140
There is a known Western soldier and his daughter.

15
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.640
Through disinheritance of remains, the last book,

16
00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.210
or the disintegrating garment worn in the camp,

17
00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.170
they offer the knowledge that to survive torture

18
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.160
is to reckon through the self with the question of belief.

19
00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.940
When war finally kills him,

20
00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.320
he is invoked as “those not with us today.”

21
00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:37.420
There is a woman knitting.

22
00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.750
With her words, I witness her devotion to him.

23
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:43.710
Without her words, I know her fear.

24
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.220
I wonder how she survives.

25
00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.040
There is a lady weaving.

26
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.890
She has a sister and she feels annihilated.

27
00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.440
As though I am made of plastic,

28
00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.420
she tells everyone here that I have become a very quiet person.

29
00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.000
There is the brother, the oldest of five.

30
00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:09.970
He’s pacing in the hallway,

31
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.460
asleep in the daytime or awake at night,

32
00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.740
a better way to cope than cornering the children

33
00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.830
or detaining the war resisters.

34
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.330
Doctors have not listened well enough

35
00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.020
and psychotropics only last so long.

36
00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.150
He leaves me with drugs and recorded music.

37
00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.440
There is the youngest of them.

38
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.820
We wander the streets,

39
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.500
admiring the nature of this architecture enmeshed with our own psyches.

40
00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.280
He shows me how, when we are young,

41
00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.870
our survival depends on believing they care.

42
00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.310
Waiting for recovery, his friend told him

43
00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.720
how the birds draw the lines we need to take.

44
00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.240
But the information didn’t reach him in time.

45
00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.420
There is surviving poverty, which is not wealth,

46
00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.050
not mental illness, not crime.

47
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.580
There are minds, our minds,

48
00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.990
the stressed ground for this enclosing economy.

49
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.840
Spirits accumulated as free property.

50
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.350
The melancholy of anatomy or the anatomy of melancholy.

51
00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.900
There is Christine de Pizan believing in Joan of Arc.

52
00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.750
There is a counsellor sharing her expertise

53
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.290
in the norms and divergences of human nerves.

54
00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:44.920
There is us keeping us safe

55
00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.400
moving the construction pylons in the alley,

56
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.640
telling each other to protect our energies

57
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.850
against the denaturing of substance.

58
00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:57.500
There is a crazy bitch slouching

59
00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.870
towards dysphoria or a positive mental attitude.

60
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:05.600
She’s lost control

61
00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.420
wondering how she’s related to this Instagram therapist.

62
00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.640
There is the question: are you happy?

63
00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.240
There is no substitute for direct encounters with the

64
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:38.090
sun.
