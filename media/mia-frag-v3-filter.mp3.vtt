00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:07.440
MIA: When I… started to embark on my healing journey

2
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.400
and when I would attempt to assert, you know,

3
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:18.190
healthy boundaries or to resist relational patterns

4
00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:24.300
or dynamics that produced harm or violence…

5
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.100
…my mom would always blame my therapists.

6
00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.820
And I guess, in a way, I understand why,

7
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.060
because there was no way for me to represent to a therapist

8
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.270
the whole story of my mother’s life…

9
00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.190
…why she was the way she was.

10
00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:46.630
There were reasons.

11
00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:48.600
There were reasons.
