KAGAN: Yeah, as a spokesperson,

2
00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.810
I find that I don’t mind calling myself mad or crazy.

3
00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.540
It’s a badge of honour, or pride.

4
00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.600
I say: “I’m crazy, crazy about life.”

5
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.920
Or: “I’m mad, I’m mad about life.”

6
00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.740
There’s a sense of mad pride about it.

7
00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.820
But it’s different coming from someone without that lived experience.

8
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.710
I kind of call myself a born-again,

9
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.340
out-of-the-closet, flaming manic depressive.
