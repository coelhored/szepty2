00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.100
TRACY: yeah, it was this idea that you were sick

2
00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.110
due to an imbalance that was going on with you.

3
00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.820
That you were almost… you were in a space

4
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.080
where your emotions were taken over,

5
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.950
and you weren’t looking after yourself by getting

6
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.320
enough sleep or eating properly, or just…

7
00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.700
-- Tracey’s voice distorts --

8
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
TRACY: …sick.

9
00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.263
MANUEL: Wow.

10
00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.730
TRACY: I don’t know if that term’s used anywhere else,

11
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.410
but I don’t that when I use it here, in this territory –

12
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.960
MANUEL: You’ve never used that term for me.

13
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.960
-- Tracey’s laughter distorts, reverberating --

14
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.120
TRACY: Um… I guess not.
